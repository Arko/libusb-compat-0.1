libusb-compat-0.1
=================

A compatibility layer allowing applications written for libusb-0.1 to work
with libusb-1.0. libusb-compat-0.1 attempts to look, feel, smell and walk
like libusb-0.1.

Do not attempt to install libusb-0.1 and libusb-compat-0.1 on the same system.

Known quirks/differences from libusb-0.1:
 1. usb_resetep(), a previously deprecated function, is implemented as
    equivalent to calling usb_clear_halt().
 2. libusb-0.1 allowed you to open a device which you did not have permission
    to do anything useful with (all I/O requests would immediately fail).
	libusb-compat-0.1 does not allow you to open such devices. You can still
	read descriptor info without opening a device.
 3. usb_device's "num_children" attribute is hardcoded to 0, and "children"
    is hardcoded to NULL. Do you need this information in your software? Let
	us know on the mailing list, and we'll add it.
